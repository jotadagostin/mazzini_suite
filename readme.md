Mazzini suite website Project!

This is a website for an bed and breakfast apartment, located in Verona.
The website was already finished, but we decided to get a new and modern design for him.

  -Header HTML [x]
  -Home HTML [x]
  -Service HTML [x]
  -Room(gallery) [x]
  -About [x]
  -Footer [x]

-CSS3, for design. []
-Header CSS[x]
-Home CSS [x]
-Service CSS [x]
-Room(gallery) [x]
-About [x]
-Footer [x]

-JS Vanilla, for interactivity [x]
-Smooth scrolling [x]
